To-Do List Application built using the Spring Boot framework on the backend and a likely frontend framework (like React or similar) to provide a user interface. This project involves a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application where users can manage their to-do tasks.

𝑩𝒂𝒄𝒌𝒆𝒏𝒅:

𝑺𝒑𝒓𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝑩𝒐𝒐𝒕 𝑭𝒓𝒂𝒎𝒆𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒌: 
 ->  Using Spring Boot to manage the backend services, which include handling HTTP requests and responses, connecting to the database, and applying business logic.

𝑹𝑬𝑺𝑻𝒇𝒖𝒍 𝑨𝑷𝑰:
->  The backend exposes a RESTful API with endpoints to create, read, update, and delete to-do items. These endpoints are accessed via HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

𝑫𝒂𝒕𝒂 𝑷𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒊𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒆:
-> The project uses a relational database (like MySQL) to store to-do items. The data is managed through JPA (Java Persistence API), specifically using Spring Data JPA's JpaRepository.

 𝑬𝒏𝒕𝒊𝒕𝒚: 
 -> The ToDoList entity represents the data model for a to-do item, consisting of an id (primary key) and a title field that describes the task.
 
 𝑺𝒆𝒓𝒗𝒊𝒄𝒆 𝑳𝒂𝒚𝒆𝒓:
 -> The business logic is managed by a service layer (TodoListService), which handles operations like saving, fetching, and deleting to-do items.
 
 𝑬𝒙𝒄𝒆𝒑𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝑯𝒂𝒏𝒅𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒈:
 -> Your backend also includes basic error handling, returning appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found) when certain conditions aren't met.
 
 𝑪𝑶𝑹𝑺 𝑪𝒐𝒏𝒇𝒊𝒈𝒖𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏:
 -> The backend includes configuration to allow cross-origin requests from your frontend, particularly when the frontend is served from http://localhost:3000.
