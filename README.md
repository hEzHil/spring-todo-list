To-Do List Application built using the Spring Boot framework on the backend and a likely frontend framework (like React or similar) to provide a user interface. This project involves a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application where users can manage their to-do tasks.

Key Features of  Project:
Backend:

Spring Boot Framework: 
 ->  Using Spring Boot to manage the backend services, which include handling HTTP requests and responses, connecting to the database, and applying business logic.

RESTful API:
->  The backend exposes a RESTful API with endpoints to create, read, update, and delete to-do items. These endpoints are accessed via HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
Data Persistence: The project uses a relational database (like MySQL) to store to-do items. The data is managed through JPA (Java Persistence API), specifically using Spring Data JPA's JpaRepository.

 Entity: 
 -> The ToDoList entity represents the data model for a to-do item, consisting of an id (primary key) and a title field that describes the task.
 
 Service Layer:
 -> The business logic is managed by a service layer (TodoListService), which handles operations like saving, fetching, and deleting to-do items.
 
 Exception Handling:
 -> Your backend also includes basic error handling, returning appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found) when certain conditions aren't met.
 
 CORS Configuration:
 -> The backend includes configuration to allow cross-origin requests from your frontend, particularly when the frontend is served from http://localhost:3000.
